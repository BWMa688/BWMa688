Introducation
-------------
- 👋 Hi, I’m @BWMa688
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine learning in Materials Science and data analysis, SISSO.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning symbolic regression in perovskite ceramics. Here will be my usual use of some code, welcome to discuss with me.
- 📫 How to reach me：mabowen.sust@qq.com 

How to use
-------------
-This project covers some common ML model training and feature engineering methods  
-Note:The folder of "An Interpretable Machine Learning Strategy for (K0.5Na0.5)NO3 ceramics" includes the dataset of this work.

Attention
-------------
Cross-validation should be added during the training process to demonstrate the generalization ability of the model, and the data results should be saved for subsequent analysis
