Introducation
-------------
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BWMa688
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine learning in Materials Science and data analysis, SISSO.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning symbolic regression in perovskite ceramics. Here will be my usual use of some code, welcome to discuss with me.
- ðŸ“« How to reach meï¼šmabowen.sust@qq.com 

How to use
-------------
-This project covers some common ML model training and feature engineering methods  
-Note:the folder of "An Interpretable Machine Learning Strategy for (K0.5Na0.5)NO3 ceramics" includes the dataset of this work.

Attention
-------------
Cross-validation should be added during the training process to demonstrate the generalization ability of the model, and the data results should be saved for subsequent analysis
